# 💖 Will You Be My Valentine?

A fun, interactive Valentine-themed web page built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The page playfully asks someone to be your Valentine with two buttons: **Yes** and **No**.

- If they click **Yes** 👉 a cute popup appears confirming they’re your Valentine.
- If they click **No** 👉 the question changes every time and keeps asking in a more playful way, while visually encouraging them to choose **Yes**.

Perfect for sharing a light-hearted, nerdy confession with someone special. 💌
